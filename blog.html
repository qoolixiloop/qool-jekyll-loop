      <p><h1 id="jekyll-tutorial">Jekyll Tutorial</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>This repository hosts the source code as well as the compiled webpage of the official Jekyll step by step tutorial.  <br />
This README.md file show all the necessary steps and commands to install Ruby, a Ruby package manager, a Ruby bundler gem, Jekyll and everything else that is needed to build a website with Jekyll.<br />
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.</p>
